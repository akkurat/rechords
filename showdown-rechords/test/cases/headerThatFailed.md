Zunächst mal: [G12] [G10]

1:
[G]Oh, oh, oh, brother totem pole
I saw your legends lined up
And I never felt more natural
[am][em7]... Apart, I just
[am]came [em]apart

[G]Please, please, please, sister Socrates
You always answer with a question
Show some kindness to a petty thief
[am]... For[em]give,
you [am]did for[em]give

And watched the [C]migrants smoke in the [D7]old orange grove
And the [G]red rocket blaze over [em]Cape Canaveral   LUFT!
You’ve been a [C]father to me in [D7]1960’s, speak
Give me co[G]matose joy like we’re [em]on TV
While the [am]mountain’s side was shining
wild [D7]colors of my des[em9][em]tiny

I watched your [am]face age backwards
Changing [D7]shape in my mem[em9][em]ory
You taught me [am]victory’s sweet
Even [D7]deep in the cheap [G]seats

2:
Hey, hey, hey, mother interstate
Can you deliver me from evil
Make me honest, make me a wedding cake
Atone, I will atone

Wait, wait, wait, mighty outer space
All that flying saucer terror
Made me lazy drinking lemonade
A waste, it just went to waste

Like the Freon cold out the hotel door
Or the white rocket fade over Cape Canaveral
You’ve been a daughter to me, your buried shoe box grief
I felt your poltergeist love like Savannah heat
While the waterfall was pouring crazy symbols of my destiny

I watched your face die backwards
Little baby in my memory
You told me victory's sweet
Even deep in the cheap seats

Bridge:
[C12][C]And you don’t [em]judge me, [C12][C]that’s not your [am]style
[C12][C]But I won’t [em]see you for a [D]little [D4][D]while
[C12][C]And there’s no [em]worries, oh Lord, whose got [am]time
[C12][C]Are these [em]changes gonna fill [D]your mind

3:
Like the citrus glow off the old orange grove
Or the red rocket blaze over Cape Canaveral
It’s been a nightmare for me, some 1980’s grief
Gives me parachute dreams like old war movies
While the universe was drawn perfect circles form infinity

I watched the stars get smaller
Tiny diamonds in my memory
I know that victory's sweet
Even deep in the cheap seats
