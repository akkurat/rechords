[G]Oh, oh, oh, brother totem pole
I saw your legends lined up
And I never felt more natural
[am][em7]... Apart, I just
[am]came [em]apart

[G]Please, please, please, sister Socrates
You always answer with a question
Show some kindness to a petty thief
[am]... For[em]give,
you [am]did for[em]give

And watched the [C]migrants smoke in the [D7]old orange grove
And the [G]red rocket blaze over [em]Cape Canaveral
You’ve been a [C]father to me in [D7]1960’s, speak
Give me co[G]matose joy like we’re [em]on TV
While the [am]mountain’s side was shining
wild [D7]colors of my des[em9][em]tiny

I watched your [am]face age backwards
Changing [D7]shape in my mem[em9][em]ory
You taught me [am]victory’s sweet
Even [D7]deep in the cheap [G]seats

2:
Hey, hey, hey, mother interstate
Can you deliver me from evil
Make me honest, make me a wedding cake
Atone, I will atone
